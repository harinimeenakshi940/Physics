
"Good evening, everyone. My name is Harini Meenakshi, and I hold a Masters degree in Physics. I’ve always been deeply interested in how science and technology can solve real-world challenges. Today, I’m excited to share my insights on how renewable energy can help shape India’s sustainable future."
We all know the importance of climate, we also know how to preserve it  but we often fail to bridge that gap between intention and action.

To the best of our abilities,  we have the solutions, the knowledge, and the technology, but the real question is—how do we bring them together to create meaningful change?"

"Today, we’ll explore three key aspects:
First, a quick overview of renewable energy, the types and its significance.
Second, an inspiring real-life example of its implementation.
And finally, the challenges we must address and the small steps that you and I can take alongside government efforts, to help India reach its renewable energy targets.

Energy is neither created nor destroyed but we can convert it from one form to the other.
We have 2 types of energies
Renewable energy
Non-renewable energy
Renewable energy is an energy which does not create pollution
Non-renewable energy is the one which creates pollution
So instead of using petrol or diesel cars, we can switch to electric vehicles which does not cause pollution.

Fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas are non-renewable resources that take hundreds of years to form. Fossil fuels, when burned to produce energy, cause harmful greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide. 

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is now 50 percent higher than it was before the Industrial Revolution that back then in 18th century

So on the international level, under the Paris Agreement, we have set a target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2050


4) India's climate targets include:
Achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy capacity by 2030.
Reducing carbon intensity of GDP by 45% by 2030 (compared to 2005 levels).
Reaching net-zero emissions by 2070.
Increasing the share of renewables in total energy capacity to 50% by 2030.


5) We have different types of renewable energies:
Solar Energy: Energy from the sun.
Wind Energy: Energy from moving air.
Hydropower: Energy from flowing water.
Biomass: Energy from organic material.
Geothermal Energy: Heat within the Earth.

Opening Story: "The Transformation of Odanthurai"
"Let me tell you about a small village in Tamil Nadu called Odanthurai. A few years ago, the villagers faced regular power cuts and high energy costs. But today, they have completely transformed their energy system using renewable resources.
They installed solar panels on rooftops, which now provide electricity for homes 
A biogas plant, powered by farm waste, is used for cooking and small businesses.
Wind turbines on the village outskirts generate extra electricity, even allowing them to sell surplus power to the state grid and generating income.
During the rainy season, a small hydropower plant ensures that the village has a steady and reliable power supply.
Because of these changes, the village produces more energy than it uses. They’ve reduced pollution, lowered energy costs, and even created jobs.
Imagine if every village and city in India followed this example. Renewable energy is not just an option—it’s the key to a cleaner, brighter, and more self-reliant future."


With this pictorial representation, solar capacity is a clear leader in the renewable energy sector, indicating that solar energy is a key focus for the country's energy transition.

While solar energy leads, wind and hydropower continue to provide critical backup and stability to the grid, especially during periods of low sunlight, thus supporting a more consistent renewable energy supply.


This way India has successfully diversified its renewable energy sources,from solar (92.12 GW), wind (47.36 GW), and hydropower (51.99 GW). 
This diversity helps to reduce dependency on any single energy source, enhancing energy security.

Renewable energy now makes up 46.3% of India’s total energy capacity, that means we are moving close to our goals that is achieving 50% renewable energy capacity by 2030.





6) Challenges and solutions
Promoting awareness through various initiatives like PM-KUSUM, UJALA- will look into this further.
High initial costs for large-scale renewable energy projects.
Outdated grid infrastructure and difficulties in storing energies for this we have to rely upon the imports.
Lack of skilled workforce for installation and maintenance- for this we can set up training programs to increase skilled workforce- it also promotes job creation.
Unequal access to renewable energy technologies globally- for this we can foster international collaborations for technology sharing and Strengthen global agreements and cross-border renewable energy trade.

We have some agreements in the international level as well some of them are Paris Agreement (2015), Kyoto Protocol (1997),International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Framework,International Solar Alliance (ISA), UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7). The goal is to Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, with a strong focus on renewable energy by 2030.

Government Initiatives/scheme:

- Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM): Aimed at promoting solar energy among farmers, this scheme encourages the installation of solar pumps and grid-connected solar power plants.

- PLI Scheme for Solar PV Modules: To reduce dependence on imported solar modules, the government has launched the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which promotes domestic manufacturing of solar panels.

- Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana: This scheme focuses on the development of large-scale solar energy projects.

- Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects: These initiatives aim to establish large solar parks, especially in states like Rajasthan and Gujarat, to enhance the installed capacity.

- Green Energy Corridor Scheme: The scheme focuses on creating the necessary infrastructure for efficient transmission of renewable energy from generation points to consumption centers.

- National Green Hydrogen Mission: This mission aims to promote the development of green hydrogen technology to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

- National Bioenergy Programme: This program focuses on promoting bioenergy production from agricultural residues, waste, and biomass.

- FDI in Renewable Energy: The government has opened up the renewable energy sector for foreign direct investment (FDI) to encourage private investment in the sector.

What’s the plan of action for us?
Turn off lights and fans when it's not used.
Instead of using fluorescent, or halogen bulbs, use LED bulbs.
Whatever waste we get in the kitchen, we can utilize that waste to create compost pits or produce biogas.
Use public transport or carpool instead of driving alone to reduce fuel consumption.
Instead of using disposable plastic bottles, use reusable water bottles made of stainless steel or glass.
Use natural light during the day instead of turning on artificial lights.
And the most important one Bas “Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam” thats an initiative started by govt last year– atleast plant one tree on your bday or another special days. It helps to absorb carbon dioxide and improve air quality.
Conclusion:
"The future depends on what we do in the present."
With collective efforts—from individuals to governments, and international agreements—we can build a cleaner, more sustainable world for future generations. Let's bridge the gap between intention and action and work towards a greener tomorrow."
Jai Hind!
